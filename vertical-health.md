firstitem-title: Patient Centricity
firstitem-colour: blue

firstitem-body: Health care provision has historically been designed around moving patients through a system as efficiently as possible.<br />In our primary research with cancer patients we discovered that this top-down approach is not working efficiently for the very people it is meant to serve.

firstitem-list:
 - Patients regularly carry around huge folders of notes to manage a complex process.
 - Patients want greater ownership and transparency over their condition.
 - Patients are highly intelligent about their condition and want raw data over dumbed down summaries.
 - Little or no provision is made for the emotional side for life-changing conditions like cancer.

firstitem-2ndpara: We believe there are numerous opportunities to realise cost-savings, improve patient experience and life expectancies by considering health care as a network around individuals rather than asking a patient to pass through unconnected silos.

item-2-title: Smart Research
item-2-colour: green

item-2-body: In our interactions with the Health sector we have noticed that Research Scientists are increasingly using Computer Science to accelerate processes and discovery and to reduce costs.

item-2-list:
 - Research Scientists are developing programming skills.
 - Organisations are buying misplaced off-the-shelf data products.
 - Big Data is being widely espoused but is poorly understood.
 - An emerging discipline of data visualisation.

item-2-2ndpara: We believe that by formalising a symbiotic relationship between the two disciplines of Research Science and Computer Science organisations can realise cost-savings, shorten discovery cycles and deliver a Smart Research capability.<br />Furthermore for publicly funded organisations and charities we advocate an Open Data Policy where research data is made available to third-parties by default. We believe that unlocking new meaning from data through openness and collaboration has the potential to accelerate discovery and understanding.
