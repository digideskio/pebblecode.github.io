## Seminar Details
seminar-title: Innovating like a startup
seminar-subtitle: In the trenches
seminar-intro: There has been a lot of talk about how companies need to be more innovative, but very little on what stops them from doing so. Innovation inside of an existing company is much harder than a startup. For most companies it feels like innovation can only happen by chance, not by design. The question is – why? Join us at “Innovating like a Startup” as we lead an interactive discussion and workshop to identify root causes and bottlenecks companies face when creating a culture of continuous innovation.
