## Some History

Founded in early 2010 we have created software for startups, investment funds, gaming companies &amp; enterprises across many industries. pebble {code} was forge from its sister company <a href="http://pebbleit.com">pebble.it</a> (who provide creative IT support &amp; solutions) with whom we still share an office, an ethos and a social life. 

We believe in employee empowerment over management layers and seek to find difficult and challenging problems for our staff to tackle. We give our staff autonomy to build their workflows the way they want to and favour responsibility over micro-management. 
 
Experimentation and exploration has always been central to our culture and from inception we have run regular Hack Days and offered 10% time for our staff to express this.

We continue to obsess about client satisfaction, building a great place to work and hiring the best talent!
