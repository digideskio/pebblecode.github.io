## Promoting autonomy, mastery and purpose

In 2010 Alex and George were programming and renting desks from [pebble.it][2] and quickly began to have too much work for themselves. Shortly after that Toby bounded over to them and suggested they start a business. Thus pebble {code} was born.

The common vision of pebble's founders is to build the company that they wanted to work at. They knew that designers and developers are smart, self-organising people who crave autonomy and hate heavy management layers. They knew that for innovation to thrive collaboration, teamwork and an inspiring environment were all that mattered. 

Embracing Lean and Agile philosophies we put highly talented creative technologists into small cross-functional teams and watch great things happen. 

## Learning Together

Promoting innovation expresses itself in a strong culture of experimentation, learning and hacking. Staff are able to take 10% time to experiment with new techniques and technologies. The business runs regular hack days that promote innovation and collaboration. Each month anyone is free to present a [lightning talk][1] on a topic of interest. We are interested in learning together and continuing to explore. 

Now thirty strong we maintain the love of experimentation and innovation that we had when we started it all and are more energised than ever by the disruption that technology is bringing.
