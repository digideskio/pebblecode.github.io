## Seminar Details
seminar-title1: Health
seminar-title2: Innovation
seminar-subtitle: In the trenches
seminar-intro-paragraphs:
 - There has been a lot of talk about how companies need to be more innovative, but very little on what stops them from doing so.
 - nnovation inside of an existing company is much harder than a startup. For most companies it feels like innovation can only happen by chance, not by design. The question is – why?
 - Join us at “Innovating like a Startup” as we lead an interactive discussion and workshop to identify root causes and bottlenecks companies face when creating a culture of continuous innovation.
