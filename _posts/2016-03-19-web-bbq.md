At Google's [Progressive Web Apps event in London](http://lanyrd.com/2016/progressive-web-apps-london/) last week, the 
Chrome team shared just how many [exciting new possibilities are on the horizon](https://www.chromestatus.com/features) 
for web developers. But one of the new APIs stood out beyond all others: *Web BBQ*.

Web BBQ was unveiled by Googler [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake). As it sounds, it offers the 
tantalising promise of having a common way to communicate with outdoor barbecues, via a built-in Web API. The aim is 
to democratise the control of barbecues, by standardising how your browser talks to them.

Imagine arriving at a friend's barbecue party and the sausages are sizzling away. Suddenly your host is called away, 
just when the bacon is about to burn! Thankfully, with your mobile phone, you can turn down the heat yourself, without 
waiting to download a native app first. Your host's bacon has just been saved, thanks to Web BBQ!

The Web BBQ specification is currently an early draft. Google are leading the way, but Firefox and Microsoft Edge are 
also involved and showing strong interest. The only risk might be Safari; rumours have it that Apple are planning to 
reveal their own *Apple BBQ* later this year.
