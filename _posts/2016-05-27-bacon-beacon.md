## How can a business avoid spending time and money on something that nobody wanted, or was destined to fail from the start?

{% include youtube.html id="EHGczDHTDpo" %}

Every product story starts with a great idea. In March 2016, over 66,000 new companies were registered in the UK - a proportion of these will be setting out on an adventure - an idea leading to the genesis of a product, and an entrepreneur dreaming of success.

Statistically, 20% of these businesses fail within the first year, and a further 50% are no more by year 2.

For some, those failures represent a great investment of time and money - potentially their life’s savings - all in the hope of realising their idea. The same is true for established businesses - an initiative that might promise to shape a company’s future could turn out to be a waste of time and money.

Here at pebble {code}, we’re involved daily in helping organisations big and small realise the potential value of an idea and driving it forward from concept to commercial success with a minimum of risk.

Let’s look at one key component of the Lean Movement - one that we have found to be invaluable in reducing the inherent risks involved in trying to build an innovative product: The Minimum Viable Product.

The [wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is “a product which has just enough features to gather validated learning about the product and its continued development” - but what does this mean, and how can we use it?

At its most basic level, if you set out to build the ‘MVP’ for your idea, you are presenting a hypothesis - a statement that you believe to be true - and then committing to build and deliver the bare minimum of functionality required to test it.

To cite an example: [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/) is an online shoe retailer purchased by Amazon for £1.2bn in 2009. Today, it has revenues of over $1bn. Created in 1999 by Nick Swinmurn, it’s a shining example of an early eCommerce success. Nick recognised an opportunity for online shoe retail after failing to find the specific pair of Airwalk shoes he wanted to purchase in his local mall.

Zappos did not begin with multiple millions of dollars pumped into warehousing, logistics, marketing and eCommerce technology. It instead began with a simple MVP:

*Hypothesis:* People will buy shoes online.

*MVP:* Nick went around local shoe stores, took pictures of the items they had for sale, and built a rudimentary website which displayed these pictures alongside their prices. If somebody wanted to buy them, he’d go back to the store, pay full price and send them on. This enabled him to quickly, and cheaply, test his hypothesis. Once proven, he was ready to take it to the next step.

Homer Simpson's Car is an shining example of a product that desperately needed an MVP - the feature list sounds great on paper (“Shag Carpeting? Wow!”), and even meets all of the original requirements (engine, steering wheel, four tyres)  but nobody ever took a moment to check what the customer actually needed. Even if you were to conduct market research, the consumer might seem initially excited by the three horns play the song ‘La Cucaracha’, but if you were to install the horn in their current vehicle, how many would actually use it? Surely it would turn out to be too noisy and embarrassing.

If you were to deliver a working prototype with just one simple implementation of a  feature you are able to start gathering valuable feedback immediately. You might learn that:

- What you’ve designed is on the right track, but needs a few enhancements;
- Your feature is not needed. You’re solving a problem nobody has;
- *Or* You’ve hit the nail on the head, right from the get go, and can move on to the next most important feature or requirement.

In the worst case scenario, you’ve avoided spending months or years, and a great deal of money, developing a product that nobody wants, based on a faulty hypothesis; in the best case, you’ve validated your idea, proven it with real customer trials, and even started to generate a buzz about your product.

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is a veritable banquet of MVPs. Some of these are no more than concepts - they’re asking for people to put their money where their mouth is, and supporting an idea before it hits the market. The hypothesis is quite simply “I think people will pay me money for this thing”. If they do, then not only do you have validation of your idea, you have capital with which to pursue it. If you don’t reach your funding target, well, back to the drawing board - at worst you’ve spent a few hours creating a snazzy video, and not invested your life’s savings.

Hopefully, the value of developing your MVP is clear - now, how do we go about it?

There are key starting points - all of which have been well explained elsewhere, so I’ll summarise them here, with links if you would like to learn more.

#### [Develop your Hypothesis](https://medium.com/philosophie-is-thinking/how-to-craft-an-mvp-hypthesis-statement-31e7895e4017)
This is your guiding principle - the idea that your MVP is going to test.

#### [Map your User Story](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/august/creating-an-agile-roadmap-using-story-mapping)
The user story demonstrates the individual features required to allow the user to accomplish their objectives. These features will become your user stories in development.

![Story Mapping](/img/posts/2016-05-25-minimum-viable-product/story-map.png)

#### Prioritise the Features
Order from top to bottom all of the features you’ve identified, by asking these five questions:

- How important is this feature for accomplishing the objective?
- How often will this feature be used?
- How many users will use this feature?
- How much value will the feature bring to the customer?
- How risky is this feature?

#### Define the ‘[Walking Skeleton](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Walking+skeleton)’
Draw a line on the Map of your user stories that divides the features that are essential to completing the objective, and those that are not. The features above the line are your Minimum Viable Product. Those below it represent the long-term vision of your product.

## Conclusion

By using the MVP approach, we can ensure we achieve a major goal in applying Lean principles to product development - avoiding waste. By focusing on the ‘must-haves’ we avoid working on unimportant things and we learn quickly, before committing time and resources to something that isn’t needed or doesn’t work as expected.

We’ve found these concepts insanely valuable in the work we do here at pebble {code}. By embracing MVP, User-Centric Design, Rapid Prototyping and Agile Development, we ensure that we’re constantly delivering ‘The Right Thing’ and ‘The Thing Right’ for our clients.








A better way to find bacon

Here at pebble we love getting to share our way of working with new people, so on Thursday 26th May, we invited a team from PA Consulting to spend a day hacking in our offices.

The theme was retail and consumer goods. After some breakfast and a brief introductions, we started discussing ideas and forming teams. Having seen a presentation by the https://www.wayfindr.net/ team, I had a desire wanted to explore the potential of iBeacon technology, and quickly narrowed my areas of interest to in-store navigation. Not long later, Bacon Beacon was born. But we’ll get to that in a bit. First, let me tell you about a young man named Louis.

It’s 10:45am. Louis wakes up, groggy from last night’s great party. He hears a buzzing beside you and see a notification on screen from his mum. “Good morning! Be with you in 15 minutes, can’t wait to see your new flat!”. His body jolts into action as he swiftly realises he is completely unprepared for the brunch he had arranged to cook for his parents. The fridge is empty. He know there’s a Tesco Superstore round the corner, but having never been, he knows he will never find all the things you need in time. So many aisles, so many miles of walking! If only there was some way to pinpoint exactly locations of the products he wanted to buy. 

Alas, Louis lives in a world without Bacon Beacon. This means he had to search the whole store for his bacon. While he was endlessly wandering , his parents turned up at his flat, saw he wasn’t in, and departed in fury. They disowned Louis shortly after. He fell into a deep spiral of depression, travelled to thailand to find himself, met a spiritual guru, and was never heard of again.

Meanwhile, at pebble {code} Rob Armes, Ian Black, Conrad Crates and Dave Hillier were working hard. 

Our Goal
To navigate to a product in a store

Our Process
We split the team into two strands. The development team were to get to work on reading locations from iBeacons, while the design team would figure out the user experience.

After figuring out some hardware issues, the development team chose to build a native android app, in order to access the bluetooth and compass capabilities of the phone, but struggled to accurately read information in a room of 25 different beacons. By the end of the day, they were able to get an arrow on the device to point to different beacons, but ran out of time to build any navigational guidance based on the phones’ position.

Meanwhile the design team produced a set of wireframes, created an animation to visualise the experience of the app, and worked on a marketing site design to sell the product.

The Outcome
While we couldn’t use the app to navigate, it was a great experience for the team. We met new people, with different skillsets, and got to try out some new tech too. We also lost the hack day, but hopefully, with a bit more work, our idea could help stop the world losing more people like Louis.
