### How far would you agree with the above statement? If you could visualise the emotional state of the world, what would it looks like?

I never used to find myself wondering the answers to these questions, but thanks to Art Hackathon 2015, I can now show you the answer.

Whilst we were satisfied with our creation, the rest of the room blew us away. Digital magic, musical fruit salads, face-tracking forests and 3D museum pieces filled both physical and digital spaces.

## Sadness
But all good things must come to an end. With regret we dismantled our pieces, said our thank yous and goodbyes, and departed. The installations may be gone, but thankfully the internet is still going strong and you can check out the [Emoti visualisation here](http://www.iblack.co.uk/emoti/), (or view the source code on [Github](https://github.com/itomblack/emotion-twitter).)
